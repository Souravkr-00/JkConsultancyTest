      question: "What are the key requirements for studying abroad?",
      answer: "Key requirements typically include academic transcripts, language proficiency tests (like IELTS or TOEFL), a valid passport, financial proof, letters of recommendation, and a statement of purpose. Requirements may vary by country and institution, so always check specific university guidelines."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "How do I choose the right country for my studies?",
      answer: "Consider factors like education quality, course availability, tuition costs, living expenses, scholarship opportunities, language requirements, work permits, visa policies, and cultural fit. Research the job market in your field and potential for post-graduation work opportunities."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "What scholarships are available for international students?",
      answer: "International students can apply for merit-based scholarships, need-based grants, government-funded scholarships, university-specific awards, and field-specific funding. Look into options like Fulbright, Chevening, Commonwealth Scholarships, and Erasmus Mundus, as well as scholarships offered by your home country."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "How far in advance should I start my application process?",
      answer: "Begin at least 12-18 months before your intended start date. This gives you time to research programs, prepare for and take standardized tests, gather documents, apply for scholarships, and complete visa applications. Application deadlines vary, but many universities have deadlines 6-9 months before the academic year begins."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Can I work while studying abroad?",
      answer: "Work regulations vary by country. Many popular destinations allow international students to work part-time (typically 10-20 hours per week) during the semester and full-time during breaks. Some countries also offer post-study work visas. Check the specific work rights attached to your student visa before making plans."
